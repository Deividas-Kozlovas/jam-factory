# Jam factorie

A project built with Express.js and React.js. This project allows you to create and receive jam data and track the efficiency of the jam production process in the factory.

## Setup

The project is divided into two main parts:

- jam-factory-backend: Express.js backend to handle API requests, manage data, and handle business logic.
- jam-factory-frontend: React.js frontend to interact with the backend and display the jam-related data and efficiency metrics.
  Each folder contains detailed setup instructions for the respective part of the project.
